# Employee-Tracker

## Description
I made an employee tracker. If you have a lot of employees, their roles and who they report to can be confusing and can be easily mixed up. Having a tracker like this can be very helpful in keeping track of your employees. It can also allow the empolyer to edit, add, and delete any information easily without any coding knowledge.

I learned how to string together different connection.queries and was able solidify how to use SQL in my head.

*Note: My personal computer has a strange memory bug with MySQL, causing node to repeat questions and answers, hence why I kill the terminal periodically. This may or may not happen on your device.
